"""
real_jsearch.py — live JSearch (RapidAPI) client.
Confirmed live against the /search-v2 endpoint during testing — the
older /search endpoint returns 404, it was deprecated on RapidAPI's
side. Auth is header-based (X-RapidAPI-Key), not URL params like Adzuna.
Cursor-paginated, not page-numbered — pass back the cursor from the
previous response's data.cursor to get the next page; None/empty means
no more results.

Timeout is 59s, not the usual 15s — search-v2 does live aggregation
under the hood (not a pre-indexed lookup like Adzuna), and real testing
showed successful calls already taking up to 12s. A tight timeout was
killing entire workflows over normal latency variance, not real
failures. A timeout gets exactly ONE retry at the same 59s limit, then
fails — if the vendor is genuinely this slow twice in a row, retrying
further just burns quota for no benefit.

Transient 5xx errors are retried with backoff (unchanged, same pattern
as real_adzuna.py). 4xx errors (bad key, bad query) are not retried,
since those won't fix themselves.
